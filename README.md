# Ola Booking Conversion Analysis

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a simulated Ola cab booking dataset. The project uses **MySQL** for data processing and **Power BI** for visualization to extract meaningful insights into booking patterns, user behavior, and operational metrics. The dataset, comprising 40,000 entries, was synthetically generated using ChatGPT to emulate real-world scenarios.

## Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL**: Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis through SQL queries.
- **Power BI**: Creation of interactive dashboards for data visualization.
- **ChatGPT**: Generation of a synthetic dataset mimicking Ola's booking data.

## Project Structure

- `OLA-Bookings-40000-Rows.xlsx`: The primary dataset containing 40,000 synthetic booking records.
- `Cleaned Data.csv`: The dataset after data cleaning and preprocessing.
- `Ola bookings_ SQL_Analysis.sql`: SQL scripts used for data analysis and transformation.
- `Dash board.png` & `Ola_Dashboard*.png`: Visual representations of the Power BI dashboards created.

## Key Insights

- **Booking Trends**: Analysis of peak booking hours, days, and seasonal variations.
- **User Behavior**: Insights into user preferences, frequent routes, and cancellation patterns.
- **Operational Metrics**: Evaluation of ride durations, distances, and driver performance.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anshit1m/Ola_Booking_Convertion.git
   ```
2. **Database Setup**:
   - Import `OLA-Bookings-40000-Rows.xlsx` into your MySQL database.
   - Execute the SQL scripts in `Ola bookings_ SQL_Analysis.sql` to perform data cleaning and analysis.
3. **Power BI Visualization**:
   - Open Power BI Desktop.
   - Load `Cleaned Data.csv` into Power BI.
   - Use the provided `.png` files as references to recreate the dashboards or customize them further.

## Notes

- The dataset is entirely synthetic and was generated for educational and analytical purposes.
- The project serves as a demonstration of data analysis and visualization techniques and does not reflect actual Ola data.
